# github-digest-web

The Web UI for GitHub Digests.

## Ideas

* Perhaps this could be generalized into a service that could aggregate any stream of notifications into daily digests! And then GitHub could just be one source of potentially many. Maybe I could call it something like “digestify” or “digestifier”. Would be a lot more work but potentially fun and interesting and worthwhile.
